Scratch Terminal Training Summary

I completed the Scratch training focused on Make, Shell, Git, and basic coding principles.

I began by building and running a Makefile that compiled a simple C program using dependencies and targets. I added a clean target to remove generated files and verified that everything worked correctly. I also created a README to explain the project structure and usage.

In the Shell section, I practiced basic commands like cd, ls, mkdir, cp, and mv, along with redirection using >, >>, and pipes. I wrote a simple shell script called test.sh, made it executable, and ran it using bash.

I explored file permissions using chmod, used wc, grep, and sort, and added aliases to my .bashrc file for quick command access.

Finally, I initialized a Git repository for my training folder and committed all relevant files, including the Makefile, source code, script, and this review summary.

This session helped me get more comfortable with the terminal and using make effectively for automating simple builds.
